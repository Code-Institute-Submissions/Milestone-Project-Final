Nordic Choice Hotels Payroll Informational Webpage
First Milestone Project: Code Institute, User Centric Frontend Development 

This is a wickipedia like webpage that provides information on various payroll
related topics for the employees of Nordic Choice Hotels. It is meant as a 
information resource for the employees.


UX
I aimed to create a easily navigated site in a color scheame typical for
the company. 

My hope is that employees will be ablle to find condensed easily understood 
answeres to the questions most comonly asked to the payroll departemnt. 
Say that an employee wants to understand how the deduction for income tax
is determined. Prevously they had to email the payroll office and might have to wait 
up to a week for an answer. Using this webpage they may find the answer to their
question them selves. This will not only benefit the employee but will also help
ease the workload for the payroll departemnt.

Features
The site uses a bootstrap navigation bar that colapses when viewed on smaller screens.
Through out the site there is various links to external resources. 

Features left to implement.
-There is a search window that does not perform searches. In the future I would like 
to get this function up and runing.
-The contact page does not send emails.
-The page does not currently contain a complete list of the topics that an employee might 
seek information about. I have built the site with the consideration that more topics should 
be added in the future.

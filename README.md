# Nordic Choice Hotels Payroll Informational Website
##### First Milestone Project, Code Institute, User Centric Frontend Development 

This is a site that provides information on various payroll
related topics for the employees of Nordic Choice Hotels. The site is meant 
to answer frequently asked questions about the topics.


## UX
I aimed to create a easily navigated site in a blue color scheame wich is typical for
the company. 

My hope is that employees will be able to find condensed easily understood 
answeres to the questions most comonly asked to the payroll departemnt. 
Say that an employee wants to understand how the deduction for income tax
is determined. Prevously they had to contact their manager whom emailed the payroll office.
The manager then had to wait up to a week for a reply. After that the manager had to explain or forward the response to the employee.

This website is meant to make this chain of information shorter and create efficencys for employees, managers and the payroll department.
Using this webpage the employee can look up an question emidiatly without the involvment of a manager. This will
also lighten the workload of the payroll department. 

To get a basic concept of what the page might look like I made a simple wireframe using the free [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) tool.

Ther is a contact page but it has purpusly been semi-hidden. The only way to get to it is by clicking the email symbol in the footer.
The idea is that the employee should look thrue the site and only make contact after having tryed to find
the answer to the question on the site. 


## Features
The site uses a bootstrap navigation bar that colapses when viewed on smaller screens.
Through out the site there is various links to external resources. 

#### Features left to implement.
- There is a search window that does not perform searches. In the future I would like 
to get this function up and runing.
- The contact page does not send emails.
- The page does not currently contain a complete list of the topics that an employee might 
seek information about. I have built the site with the consideration that more topics should 
be added in the future.
 - I would like to add various input elements that would help the employee
make sallery related calculations. For example; on the taxation page there is currently
a link to a page that helps the employee find his taxation tabel. I would like
this function to be availible directly on the taxation page.

## Technologies Used
- [HTML/CSS](https://www.w3.org/html/) to write the code.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) to simplyfy the design process.

## Testing.
All text have been proof read and fact checked to ensure that the user will get easily understood and acurate 
information on the topics covered. Links have been manualy tested to ensure they open in a new seperate window and that the 
destination is the intended. All pages have been tested for compatability with the standard screen sizes in google 
developers tools. All code have been validated using the W3C validator.

## Deployment.
The project was deployed by uploading to Git Hub.
